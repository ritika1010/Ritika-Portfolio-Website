            </h1>
            Hello there! I am Ritika Deshpande, currently pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science at Columbia University, New York. I am a versatile and dedicated software engineer seeking new challenges and opportunities. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can contribute my problem solving skills to drive innovation. I excel in cross functional teams as I firmly believe that best solutions are born from collaboration and communication.
With 2+ years of experience in the industry as a full stack developer, I have been on a continuous journey of learning and growth. I am currently looking for opportunities for Summer 2024 internships in Software Engineering and Management, that would help me learn, contribute and grow.
